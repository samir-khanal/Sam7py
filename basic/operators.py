# arithmetic operators
# +,-,*,/,%,**,//
# print(s+s)

print("ram" + "sita")
# print(100/0) shows error
print(2 ** 4)

# print(24//5) it removes the point and shows lowest possible ex: 4.8 is answer and it shows 4.

# assignment operators
# =,-=,*=
# x=10
# x+=20

# logical operators
# and,or,not

# Comparison operators
# ==,>,<,>=,!=,<=

# print(5==10) and the answer is False.
# print(5<10)

# Bitwise Operators
# &,/,^,!

# Special operators
# identity operators: is, is not
# membership operators: in, not in
# x=5

# print(x is z)
#
# print(id(x))
# print(id(y))
# print(id(z))

# name= "sophia"
# print("a" in name) it shows true as name contains "a" letter
# print("x" in name) false
